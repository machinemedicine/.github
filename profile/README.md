About us

Machine Medicine Technologies is facilitating the next generation of neurotherapeutics by building software for the intelligent, personalised optimisation of neuromodulation and other precision therapeutics. Our flagship product, Kelvin, is in use at multiple Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) sites across the globe, enabling the collection of large datasets of unparalleled quality. This data is being utilised to develop a SaMD (Software as Medical Device) tool for automated clinical assessment of Parkinsonâ€™s disease. 

The FDA awarded our technology Breakthrough Device Designation, recognizing its potential to revolutionize the MedTech industry.
